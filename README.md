**"The future of marketing is not persuasive. It is functional."**  
*Created by Diego Martinez*  
ToolMarketing is a new strategic discipline that transforms marketing into an engineering of value delivery.

## What is ToolMarketing?

**ToolMarketing** is a strategic approach that replaces persuasive tactics with **functional tools that deliver recurring value**.

Itâ€™s not content.  
Itâ€™s not a lead magnet.  
Itâ€™s not funnel automation.  

Itâ€™s a system based on **Recurring Value Tools (RVTs)** â€” digital, physical or hybrid tools that operate as living, autonomous channels of relationship, intelligence, and conversion.

> Conversion is no longer the starting point.  
> **Functionality comes first.**

## Why does this matter?

Over the last 20 years, marketing has become a war for attention.  
But attention is different from trust. And persuasion is different from value.

**ToolMarketing breaks that cycle.**

- It **serves before it sells**.  
- It **works before it convinces**.  
- It **delivers utility before any offer**.

### FIRE â€“ Marketing Pillars

- **Functionality**: solves a real user need.  
- **Integrity**: works even without conversion.  
- **Recurrence**: delivers value across time.  
- **Experience**: focused on usability.

### SPAT â€“ Technical Pillars

- **Strategy**: strategic objectives and alignment.  
- **Processes**: replicable and measurable flows.  
- **Automation**: autonomous operation.  
- **Traffic**: continuous inbound and outbound flow.

## ðŸ§ª Innovations Introduced by ToolMarketing

ToolMarketing introduced a new set of concepts and practices that redefine how marketing is done:

- **Value before attention** â€“ functionality replaces persuasion as the foundation of trust.  
- **Recurring Value Tool (RVT)** â€“ one autonomous tool that integrates offer, utility, and intelligence.  
- **Tool behavior model** â€“ includes the patterns of **Cycle**, **Change**, **Graph**, and **Orbit** to define how value is generated, spread, and retained.  
- **Function-based segmentation** â€“ audience targeting based on what users want to do, not who they are.  
- **Integration of marketing and technology** â€“ creating an entire category of functional software as conversion.  
- **Software as Marketing (SaM)** â€“ using simple, free tools as the main vehicle for value delivery.  
- **Service as Marketing (SaM)** â€“ delivering automated recurring services before asking for commitment.  
- **Customer pain execution** â€“ addressing real user problems through tools that solve, simulate or guide before the sale.
- **FDI â€“ Functional Driven Intelligence** â€“ intelligence gathered through user interaction with tools, ethically and in real-time.  
- **FDX â€“ Functionality-Driven Experience** â€“ customer experience focused on action, not attention.  
- **Complete operational framework** â€“ combining strategy, design, implementation and ongoing optimization across three levels (strategic, tactical, operational) and three layers (market, digital, physical).
